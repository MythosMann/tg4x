The TG4x
A cheap, opensource, qmk powered 40%.
Summary
Basically, this would be a ~$30-35 qmk powered 40% keyboard using parts from a "cop car" keyboard.  The name comes from the fact that it's a step up (TG4x), but also that it's a 40%(think 4x%).  Since the TG3's are so cheap, and they come with switches (mx blacks, too), caps, and plates, they're a great start for a handwired build.  However, not many people have the time or resources to make a handwired build.  I wnated to make something that's more fun than buying a Redragon k552, but at the same price point.  My goal for this project is to drag more people down into the wallet-sucking abyss, without sucking people's wallets.
How it would work:
I'd probably sell it three ways; a barebones kit, a kit with everything you'd need, and fully assembled keyboards.  
- The barebones kits would be the pcbs, diodes, standoffs, and a pre-programmed controller.  You'd need to buy your own TG3 and cut the plates yourself.
