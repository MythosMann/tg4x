# tg4x
The tg4x is and open source 40% keyboard.  The idea is to make a dirt-cheap qmk powered keyboard by recycling parts from a TG3 "cop car keeb".  The only things that you should need to buy are the tg4x pcb (price yet unknown, hoping to get it less than $10), a pro micro (~$5), and a TG3 (~$20).  Basically, you cannibalize the TG3's switches, keycaps, plate, and back plate.
