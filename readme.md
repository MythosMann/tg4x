Last gen prototype using tg3 as a base.
![tg3 mod](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MythosMann/tg4x/master/tg3%20mod.jpg)

## Summary:
Basically an open-source, cheap 45% keyboard.  You can use parts from a tg3 keyboard for maximum cheap, or use standard ansi keycaps.

## Features:
*Staggered 45%, meaning an extra column over standard 40%.

*Multiple supported layouts, including split spacebar.

*QMK compatible.

*Driven by pro micro, easily programmable and cheap.

*Uses standard sized keycaps that you could find in any set.

*RGB underglow, used for layer indication and caps lock.

*Design for pcb plates.

*Optional 6° angle.


## The base (TG3):
You can either use a tg3 as the base for this, or use your own parts.  The advantages of using the tg3 are price and sturdy-ness.  With a tg3, you can get Cherry blacks, uniform dcs keycaps, a steel mounting plate, and an aluminum back plate, all for $15-25.  If you were to buy the absolute cheapest keycap set ($6-8), the cheapest switches ($5 for 50), an fr4 or aluminum plate (~$10-15), and use a scrap of something for the back plate, it'd cost a bit more, and you'd be dealing with low quality parts. Granted, it takes some work to desolder and mod the tg3.
