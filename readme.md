## Summary:
Basically an open-source, cheap keyboard.  You can use parts from a tg3 keyboard for maximum cheap, or use standard ansi keys.

## The base (TG3):

In case you didn't know, the TG3 is some kind of industrial keyboard. They're available for super cheap, and they're quite common (at least here in the CONUS). They come with genuine Cherry MX black switches. They also have this rubber membrane that goes over all the switches to keep dust and liquids out. You can use the membrane to add weight and tactility to the switches if you want. The TG3 comes with thin doubleshot (ABS I think) keycaps with a uniform profile. I think I heard somewhere that they're R1 DCS keycaps.
